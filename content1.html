<p>SINGAPORE (May 29): Chasen Holdings swung back to profitability in FY17 
with earnings of $2.5 million compared to a loss of $3.3 million a year ago.<br>
For the 4Q ended March, the relocation specialist also reported earnings 
$1.2 million compared to a loss last year.<br>
For the quarter and full year, group revenue of $32.3 million 
and $106.2 million respectively were 14% or $12.7 million higher
 respectively from the same periods a year ago.
 <br><br>
This was mainly due to higher revenue from specialist relocation and 
third-party logistics business segments across the geographic regions of USA,
 Thailand, Malaysia and China.
  <br><br>
For 4Q and FY17, the group’s gross profit of $10.7 million and $26.9 million 
respectively were higher than corresponding periods last year by $5.6 million 
and $9.8 million respectively in tandem with the rise in revenue.
<br><br>
Improvement in 4Q and FY17 gross profit margin by 13% and 7% 
respectively was mainly contributed by specialist relocation segment
 which attracts better gross margins than technical and engineering and
  third-party logistics business segments.
<br><br>
In its outlook, Chasen expects the relocation segment to contribute 
positively to the group’s results over the next twelve months, with the 
start of several relocation projects in China, Malaysia, USA and Vietnam.
<br><br>
The group also expects to remain profitable in FY18.
<br>
Shares of Chasen closed at 10 cents on Friday.</p>
